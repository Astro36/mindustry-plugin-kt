# Mindustry Plugin Kotlin

> [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/) Server Plugin Template written by [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

This template was inspired by [Anuken/ExamplePlugin](https://github.com/Anuken/ExamplePlugin).

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Astro36/mindustry-plugin-kt.git
    ```

2. Set your plugin information at `src/main/resources/plugin.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Your Plugin Name",
      "displayName": "Your Plugin Display Name (Default=name)",
      "author": "Developer Name",
      "description": "Your Plugin Description",
      "version": "1.0",
      "main": "ExamplePlugin",
      "minGameVersion": null
    }
    ```

    `minGameVersion` must be convertible to integer.

3. Delete original `LICENSE` file, or change license file  yours
4. Check `src/main/kotlin/ExamplePlugin.kt` for some basic commands and event handlers.

## Build

```bash
$ ./gradlew jar
```

The created jar file is located in `build/libs` directory.

Place the created jar file in the server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.
